      from root to a leaf is the huffman encoding for that leaf's
      symbol. Every time a left child is followed, that corresponds to
      a zero bit; right children are one bits.

      Traverse the tree and create a bitstring for each leaf. If the
      path from the root to the leaf happens to be Left Left Right
      Left, the bitstring for that leaf is 0010. Store these
      bitstrings in a map. The resulting map use symbols for keys and
      strings that use LEFT_CHAR for 0 and RIGHT_CHAR for 1
      (right). By default these are '.' and '^' respectively:

      key   bitstring
